# Focus Area: Problem Navigation
## Navigates issues in the development space
- Insufficient: Is generally unable to identify or work around common issues and challenges in the development / problem space
- Solid: Works around some common challenges within relevant problem space; addresses practical issues when performing common tasks in relevant systems
- Exceptional: Consistently leverages expert judgment and knowledge to anticipate common and more obscure challenges across the stack (e.g., examining surrounding environment); selects appropriate abstractions for the problem; foresees and describes the nuances of important pitfalls in development and explains how to counteract them in a larger organization
## Focuses on important problem areas and guides parts of the interview*
- Insufficient: Does not adequately work to understand one or more major aspects of the problem; fixates on minor and non-critical facets of the problem; needs continuous interviewer intervention to stay on-track
- Solid: Accurately articulates the central problem(s) to solve for; engages with big-picture or critical areas of the problem; guides and follows through with key aspects of the problem with some guidance
- Exceptional: Independently leads exploration into the most important problem areas and guides significant parts of the interview; proactively reduces ambiguity in the problem statement (e.g., how many friends can a user have?, how big is the data set?); effectively shapes how the solution should work and how components should be designed; re-prioritizes aspects of the problem based on new information
## Organizes, structures, and/or analyzes the problem space*
- Insufficient: Struggles to understand or structure the problem space; is unable to make true progress while exploring or analyzing the problem (even with hints)
- Solid: Identifies problems and systematically analyzes most smaller pieces of the problem; works to structure the problem space with some hints; identifies where issues follow the form of a known class of problem(s)
- Exceptional: Displays high levels of organization and has a clear logic to the order of topic discussions; identifies, organizes, and structures the overall problem space before analyzing sub-problems; bounds the problem and prioritizes sub-areas/ requirements (e.g., non-functional and functional)

# Focus Area: Training Data
## Considers how to acquire and label the data as appropriate
- Insufficient: Does not consider the data and labeling needs of the problem (e.g., assumes data is already prepared like a Kaggle problem)
- Solid: Demonstrates a solid understanding of training data needs and composition for the problem
- Exceptional: Proactively thinks about deep topics around the collection, labeling, and use of the data, especially in an online setting
## Chooses and justifies appropriate data solutions for the given task
- Insufficient: Is unable to suggest an appropriate solution and/or cannot connect the choice to the problem at hand
- Solid: Proposes appropriate solutions, justifying the choice by considering constraints and risks of the proposed methods
- Exceptional: Goes above and beyond by demonstrating expert-level insights into the impact of the chosen solution
## Provides implementation details for the collection of training data
- Insufficient: Describes data collection only at a high-level and is unable to provide details (e.g., suggests a split for training data without defining how to split it)
- Solid: Provides a solid level of detail such that the proposed solution could be implemented with confidence
- Exceptional: Provides a deep level of technical detail and expertise covering implementation considerations

# Focus Area: Feature Engineering
## Identifies a comprehensive set of implementable and problem-appropriate features
- Insufficient: Struggles to identify concrete sets of features or keeps the discussion too high level (e.g., suggests user demographics but not what specific demographics to quantify)
- Solid: Identifies a reasonably comprehensive set of features for the problem with enough detail to implement with confidence
- Exceptional: Goes above and beyond in identifying a comprehensive set of features that demonstrate deep expertise in the overall problem space or for a specific type of signal processing
## Organizes, structures, and prioritizes the signals
- Insufficient: Struggles to provide a clear and well structured set of signals and/or is unable to enunciate the relative value of the proposed features
- Solid: Identifies features according to a reasonable logical grouping with appropriate structure and relative importance (e.g., generates features with some structure in mind; attempts to analyze what would be the most important features for a given task)
- Exceptional: Comprehensively organizes key features and skillfully elaborates on their relative value for the modeling problem
## Considers the end-to-end use of features in the modeling solution
- Insufficient: Suggests features that would not be appropriate given the suggested modeling strategy (e.g., uses features in logistic regression that need complex pre-processing; uses high-dimensional categorical features with not enough training data or low model complexity)
- Solid: Discusses the ways in which features would be consumed or generated by models and aligns the feature engineering with the modeling strategy
- Exceptional: Independently provides a solution that optimally aligns the features and the modeling strategy; thoroughly discusses the pros/cons of their choices and their implications for the overall problem solution

# Focus Area: Modeling
## Demonstrates familiarity with relevant modeling techniques
- Insufficient: Overly relies on a small set of models which may not be appropriate for the problem, or demonstrates an overly-narrow experience with modeling techniques (e.g., uses inappropriate techniques for classification or regression)
- Solid: Demonstrates familiarity with a broad set of modeling techniques; selects an appropriate algorithm for the problem at hand and is consistent with the feature choices
- Exceptional: Shows expert-level breadth of modeling techniques, especially SOTA methods; expertly chooses and justifies modeling approaches
## Discusses technical implementation details
- Insufficient: Keeps the discussion at a very high level or does not appear to understand how the model is implemented (e.g., stick at the level of modeling APIs such as Keras or XGBoost)
- Solid: Touches on key technical choices to inform the success of the modeling strategy; discusses tradeoffs (e.g., tuning / optimization options, different architectures)
- Exceptional: Delves deep in the modeling technique and provides expert-level detail about the algorithm and architecture (e.g., problem-specific formulation and regularization choices that helps with accuracy or scalability)
## Identifies root causes and solves issues with model training
- Insufficient: Fails to identify training challenges or has no experience doing so; struggles to handle potential modeling issues/common challenges in a production environment
- Solid: Systematically probes potential failure modes of models and provides potential solutions
- Exceptional: Demonstrates expert insights into how modeling or implementation choices may lead to negative outcomes; mitigates and works through challenges, especially in large scale settings

# Focus Area: Evaluation & Deployment
## Considers the deployment and evaluation strategy
- Insufficient: Fails to consider the deployment strategy or proposes a flawed methodology (e.g., an offline-only strategy based on static dataset)
- Solid: Applies industry-standard evaluation methods in a way that gives confidence that the model performance will be correctly assessed in production
- Exceptional: Proposes a thorough solution to deployment, testing, and evaluation of models; identifies potential online risks during/post deployment and proactively considers solutions
Proposes ways to assess whether the model is performing well enough offline and online
- Insufficient: Uses generic metrics that may not be applicable to the problem setting or may not yield the desired model evaluation signal
- Solid: Suggests a reasonable set of metrics for the offline and online component of testing; provides metric details, including how the data will be collected for each component
- Exceptional: Demonstrates an expert-level discussion on model evaluation for the offline and online stages in a way that elicits high confidence in the validity of the proposed solution
